Hello and welcome to the official repository of QUEST OF DANYERIUM I - THE PRECIOUS GEMSTONE!

Story:
It is the story of an astronomer who lives in a village powered by a precious gem.
The gem also provides a force field against the evil of the surrounding world.
One day the astronomer woke up to the sound of screaming after the gem has disappeared.
He must find the gem to save the people in his village or let them die.

The whole town had a vote on who would go to save the gem.
Everyone voted for the astronomer as he/she has the only understanding of the outside world.

Feel free to look around!
